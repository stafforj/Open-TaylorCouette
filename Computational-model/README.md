# Model description

This numerical model simulates Taylor-Couette flow using Large-Eddy Simulations. This solves the filtered continuity and Navier-Stokes equations which resolve the turbulent motion down to a point (defined by a top-hat filter $\Delta = V^{1/3}$ based on the cell volume, $V$). A wall adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE) approach is implemented for the sub-grid-scale eddy-viscosity.

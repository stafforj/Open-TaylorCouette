The one used here is rated for very high power (up to 10kW) as I already had one available. Many other options are available with lower current/power rating that can be used.|

## Construction
The device is constructed from a mini food chopper, modified to rotate a cylinder at controllable rotational speeds. The speed control is necessary to adjust the flow behaviour and explore the flow instabilities that emerge at different Reynolds numbers ($R$). The estimated that the total cost of this is

## Construction
The device is constructed from a mini food chopper, modified to rotate a cylinder at controllable rotational speeds. The speed control is necessary to adjust the flow behaviour and explore the flow instabilities that emerge at different Reynolds numbers ($R$). The estimated that the total cost of this is
